# Description

This repository (“Moses_portfoilio_showreel”) is where I will be building a portfolio page, to where I would be add new work as I progress on the course.

This portfolio of work [URL link](https://moe-op.github.io/portfolio_showreel/) I will be able to showcase my skills and talents to employers when looking for a part-time or full-time position.


From this exercise, I learned several important principles for writing more organised and maintainable HTML and CSS code:

User-Friendly HTML: I improved the design of HTML to make it more user-friendly. I used elements like <header>, <section>, and <footer>, which are like building blocks which makes the web content easy to understand.
Comments: Adding comments in the code is helps explain what's going on. It's like adding captions to your code pictures, making it easier for you or others to follow along.
Semantic Simple CSS: CSS styles were organized and simplified. 
Fits Every Screen: When viewing Moses portfolio different screen sizes– the content adapts to fit the corrent screen. It looks good on big computer screens and tiny phone screens as seen below.
